# Dilemma
This script creates a ternary plot with vertices representing cost, risk, and performance. The markers on the plot indicate different trade-off scenarios:

High performance with low risk but high cost.

High risk with low cost and low performance.

High cost with low risk and low performance.

Balanced risk and performance with higher cost.

Balanced cost and performance with higher risk.

Balanced cost and risk with lower performance.



Understanding these relationships and their implications is crucial for making informed decisions that balance these factors according to the project's priorities and constraints. This balancing act is a core aspect of systems engineering, ensuring that the final system meets the necessary requirements within the available resources.

example: 

Cost Reduction Scenario:

To save money, you decide to use a less expensive but less tested component.
Impact: This decision maintains your budget but increases the risk of failure and potentially lowers the machine’s performance if the component doesn’t work as expected.

Risk Reduction Scenario:


To reduce risk, you invest in additional testing and choose components with proven reliability.
Impact: This decision maintains performance but increases costs due to more expensive components and additional testing.


Performance Maintenance Scenario:

To keep performance high without increasing costs, you might need to accept higher risks by not performing extensive testing or using less reliable components.
Impact: This decision keeps costs in check but increases the likelihood of issues or failures during operation.
